## Blog posts, &etc.

* Here is the [Evidence Inference](http://evidence-inference.ebm-nlp.com/) dataset website, which allows one to browse and download the collected data. We also provide pointers to starter code to begin working with the data and on the task.

* Here is a [blog post](http://evidence-inference.ebm-nlp.com/blog/) describing the Evidence Inference task, and our initial models.

* Source code and data for the evidence inference task is available via GitHub: https://github.com/jayded/evidence-inference.

* Here is the website for the ERASER benchmark, which includes the Evidence Inference corpus and other datasets for which targets are accompanied by supporting snippets (rationales): [http://www.eraserbenchmark.com/](http://www.eraserbenchmark.com/)

* PI Wallace spoke about the overarching goal of automating biomedical evidence synthesis on the NLP Highlights podcast: https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights/86-nlp-for-evidence-based-medicine-with-byron-wallace.
